abstract = {We investigate, by numerical simulation, the path probability of non dissipative mechanical systems undergoing stochastic motion. The aim is to search for the relationship between this probability and the usual mechanical action. The model of simulation is a one-dimensional particle subject to conservative force and Gaussian random displacement. The probability that a sample path between two fixed points is taken is computed from the number of particles moving along this path, an output of the simulation, divided by the total number of particles arriving at the final point. It is found that the path probability decays exponentially with increasing action of the sample paths. The decay rate increases with decreasing randomness. This result supports the existence of a classical analog of the Feynman factor in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics for Hamiltonian systems.}

In this work, we select several typical nonextensive systems and compute the behavior of α when a system changes its size or is divided into subsystems in different fashions. Three kinds of interactions are considered. It is found by a thought experiment that α depends on the system size and the interaction as expected and on the way we divide the system.

Around this position, there is a zone in which α is more or less constant, a situation where the sizes of the subsystems are comparable. The width of this zone depends on the interaction and on the system size. We conclude that if α is considered approximately constant in this zone, the two mathematical difficulties raised in previous studies are solved, meaning that the nonadditive relationship can characterize the nonadditivity of the system as an approximation.

abstract = {A remarkable phenomenon in the time evolution of many networks such as cultural, political, national and economic systems is the recurrent transition between the states of union and the division of nodes. We propose a phenomenological modeling, inspired by the maxim “long union divides and long division unites" to investigate the evolutionary characters of these networks composed of the entities whose behaviors are dominated by these two events. The nodes are endowed with quantities such as identity, ingredient, richness (power), openness (connections), age, distance, and interaction, which determine collectively the evolution in a probabilistic way. Depending on a tunable parameter, the time evolution of this model is mainly an alternative domination of union or division state, with a possible state of final union dominated by one single node.}

  abstract     = {We investigate the energy nonadditivity relationship E(A∪B) = E(A) + E(B) + αE(A)E(B) which is often considered in the development of the statistical physics of nonextensive systems. It was recently found that α in this equation was not constant for a given system in a given situation and could not characterize nonextensivity for that system. In this work, we select several typical nonextensive systems and compute the behavior of α when a system changes its size or is divided into subsystems in different fashions. Three kinds of interactions are considered. It is found by a thought experiment that α depends on the system size and the interaction as expected and on the way we divide the system. However, one of the major results of this work is that, for given system, α has a minimum with respect to division position. Around this position, there is a zone in which α is more or less constant, a situation where the sizes of the subsystems are comparable. The width of this zone depends on the interaction and on the system size. We conclude that if α is considered approximately constant in this zone, the two mathematical difficulties raised in previous studies are solved, meaning that the nonadditive relationship can characterize the nonadditivity of the system as an approximation. In all the cases, α tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit (N→∞) as expected.},

  abstract     = {Varentropy is used as a general measure of probabilistic uncertainty for a complex network, inspired by the first and second laws of thermodynamics, but not limited to the equilibrium system. By exploring the relationship between the varentropy of the scale free distribution and the exponent of power laws as well as network size, we get the optimal design of a scale-free network against random failures. The behaviors of varentropy and the Shannon entropy of double Pareto law degree distribution are analyzed to compare their usefulness. Our conclusion is that varentropy is suitable and reliable.},

Here we show that this relationship cannot hold exactly. In general, α in this expression inevitably depends on how a given system with constant X(1 ∪ 2) is divided into subsystems 1 and 2. Hence mathematical problems may arise when it is used to characterise the nonadditivity of the system. Nevertheless, under some conditions, it is possible to use it as a good approximation.},

The aim is to search for the relationship between this probability and the usual mechanical action. The model of simulation is a one-dimensional particle subject to conservative force and Gaussian random displacement. The probability that a sample path between two fixed points is taken is computed from the number of particles moving along this path, an output of the simulation, divided by the total number of particles arriving at the final point. It is found that the path probability decays exponentially with increasing action of the sample paths. The decay rate increases with decreasing randomness. This result supports the existence of a classical analog of the Feynman factor in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics for Hamiltonian systems.},

It is shown that such a network displays two important features recently found in small-world networks. First, the average shortest-path length is 2.4 s, the clustering coefficient of the entire network, 0.618, is greatly larger than that of the random networks with the same N (system size) and ⟨k⟩ (average degree), 0.065. We study the  detailed flight information both in a week and on a whole. In both the cases, using the Pareto distributions, we find the degree distributions follow two-segment power laws. The weight distributions have power-law tails with the exponents of around 2, and the clustering coefficient distributions follow linear distributions.},

We consider a related model, introduced by Sznajd to describe the evolution of consensus in the scale-free networks with the tunable strength (noted by Q) of community structure. In the Sznajd model, the opinion or state of any spins can only be changed by the influence of neighbouring pairs of similar connection spins. Such pairs can polarize their neighbours. Using asynchronous updating, it is found that the smaller the community strength Q, the larger the slope of the exponential relaxation time distribution. Then the effect of the initial up- spin concentration p as a function of the final all up probability E is investigated by taking different initialization strategies, the random node-chosen initialization strategy has no difference under different community strengths, while the strategies of community node-chosen initialization and hub node-chosen initialization are different in final probability under different Q, and the latter one is more effective in reaching final state.},

This composite system has a conservative Hamiltonian H = K1 + V1 + H2 where K1 is the kinetic energy of the moving body, V1 its potential energy and H2 the energy of the environment. The Lagrangian is found to be L = K1 − V1 − Ed where Ed is the energy dissipated from the moving body into the environment.
