  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {We investigate, by numerical simulation, the path probability of non dissipative mechanical systems undergoing stochastic motion. The aim is to search for the relationship between this probability and the usual mechanical action. The model of simulation is a one-dimensional particle subject to conservative force and Gaussian random displacement. The probability that a sample path between two fixed points is taken is computed from the number of particles moving along this path, an output of the simulation, divided by the total number of particles arriving at the final point. It is found that the path probability decays exponentially with increasing action of the sample paths. The decay rate increases with decreasing randomness. This result supports the existence of a classical analog of the Feynman factor in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics for Hamiltonian systems.}

In this work, we select several typical nonextensive systems and compute the behavior of α when a system changes its size or is divided into subsystems in different fashions. Three kinds of interactions are considered. It is found by a thought experiment that α depends on the system size and the interaction as expected and on the way we divide the system. However, one of the major results of this work is that, for given system, α has a minimum with respect to division position. Around this position, there is a zone in which α is more or less constant, a situation where the sizes of the subsystems are comparable. The width of this zone depends on the interaction and on the system size. We conclude that if α is considered approximately constant in this zone, the two mathematical difficulties raised in previous studies are solved, meaning that the nonadditive relationship can characterize the nonadditivity of the system as an approximation. In all the cases, α tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit (N→∞) as expected.},

We consider a whole conservative system composed of a damped moving body and its environment receiving the dissipated energy. This composite system has a conservative Hamiltonian H = K1 + V1 + H2 where K1 is the kinetic energy of the moving body, V1 its potential energy and H2 the energy of the environment. The Lagrangian is found to be L = K1 − V1 − Ed where Ed is the energy dissipated from the moving body into the environment. The usual variation calculus of least action leads to the correct equation of the damped motion.}

journal = {Chinese Physics Letters},
abstract = {A remarkable phenomenon in the time evolution of many networks such as cultural, political, national and economic systems is the recurrent transition between the states of union and the division of nodes. We propose a phenomenological modeling, inspired by the maxim “long union divides and long division unites" to investigate the evolutionary characters of these networks composed of the entities whose behaviors are dominated by these two events. The nodes are endowed with quantities such as identity, ingredient, richness (power), openness (connections), age, distance, and interaction, which determine collectively the evolution in a probabilistic way. Depending on a tunable parameter, the time evolution of this model is mainly an alternative domination of union or division state, with a possible state of final union dominated by one single node.}

Using asynchronous updating, it is found that the smaller the community strength Q, the larger the slope of the exponential relaxation time distribution. Then the effect of the initial up- spin concentration p as a function of the final all up probability E is investigated by taking different initialization strategies, the random node-chosen initialization strategy has no difference under different community strengths, while the strategies of community node-chosen initialization and hub node-chosen initialization are different in final probability under different Q, and the latter one is more effective in reaching final state.},

  abstract  = {This work is a formulation of the least action principle for classical mechanical dissipative systems. We consider a whole conservative system composed of a damped moving body and its environment receiving the dissipated energy. This composite system has a conservative Hamiltonian H = K1 + V1 + H2 where K1 is the kinetic energy of the moving body, V1 its potential energy and H2 the energy of the environment. The Lagrangian is found to be L = K1 − V1 − Ed where Ed is the energy dissipated from the moving body into the environment. The usual variation calculus of least action leads to the correct equation of the damped motion.},

The aim of this work is to show that the mechanism of PA is a consequence of the fundamental principle of least effort. We derive PA directly from this principle in maximizing an efficiency function. This approach not only allows a better understanding of the different PA mechanisms already reported but also naturally extends these mechanisms with a non-power law probability of attachment. The possibility of using the efficiency function as a general measure of attachment efficiency is also investigated.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the energy nonadditivity relationship E(A∪B) = E(A) + E(B) + αE(A)E(B) which is often considered in the development of the statistical physics of nonextensive systems. It was recently found that α in this equation was not constant for a given system in a given situation and could not characterize nonextensivity for that system. In this work, we select several typical nonextensive systems and compute the behavior of α when a system changes its size or is divided into subsystems in different fashions. Three kinds of interactions are considered. It is found by a thought experiment that α depends on the system size and the interaction as expected and on the way we divide the system. However, one of the major results of this work is that, for given system, α has a minimum with respect to division position. Around this position, there is a zone in which α is more or less constant, a situation where the sizes of the subsystems are comparable. The width of this zone depends on the interaction and on the system size. We conclude that if α is considered approximately constant in this zone, the two mathematical difficulties raised in previous studies are solved, meaning that the nonadditive relationship can characterize the nonadditivity of the system as an approximation. In all the cases, α tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit (N→∞) as expected.},

Here we show that this relationship cannot hold exactly. In general, α in this expression inevitably depends on how a given system with constant X(1 ∪ 2) is divided into subsystems 1 and 2. Hence mathematical problems may arise when it is used to characterise the nonadditivity of the system. Nevertheless, under some conditions, it is possible to use it as a good approximation.},

The aim is to search for the relationship between this probability and the usual mechanical action. The model of simulation is a one-dimensional particle subject to conservative force and Gaussian random displacement. The probability that a sample path between two fixed points is taken is computed from the number of particles moving along this path, an output of the simulation, divided by the total number of particles arriving at the final point. It is found that the path probability decays exponentially with increasing action of the sample paths. The decay rate increases with decreasing randomness. This result supports the existence of a classical analog of the Feynman factor in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics for Hamiltonian systems.},

First, the average shortest-path length is 2.4 s, the clustering coefficient of the entire network, 0.618, is greatly larger than that of the random networks with the same N (system size) and ⟨k⟩ (average degree), 0.065. We study the  detailed flight information both in a week and on a whole. In both the cases, using the Pareto distributions, we find the degree distributions follow two-segment power laws. The weight distributions have power-law tails with the exponents of around 2, and the clustering coefficient distributions follow linear distributions.},

We consider a related model, introduced by Sznajd to describe the evolution of consensus in the scale-free networks with the tunable strength (noted by Q) of community structure. In the Sznajd model, the opinion or state of any spins can only be changed by the influence of neighbouring pairs of similar connection spins. Such pairs can polarize their neighbours. Using asynchronous updating, it is found that the smaller the community strength Q, the larger the slope of the exponential relaxation time distribution. Then the effect of the initial up- spin concentration p as a function of the final all up probability E is investigated by taking different initialization strategies, the random node-chosen initialization strategy has no difference under different community strengths, while the strategies of community node-chosen initialization and hub node-chosen initialization are different in final probability under different Q, and the latter one is more effective in reaching final state.},
